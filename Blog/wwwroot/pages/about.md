My name is Robert Sundström. I'm a software developer living in Malmö, Sweden.

I'm currently working as a consultant for a Swedish consultancy company called [ESSIQ](https://www.essiq.se/). 

I have experience in both web and desktop app development. My work has been primarily with frameworks and languages such as [.NET](http://www.dot.net) (C#) and JavaScript/TypeScript. I have worked with UI technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), XAML and Razor.

In my free time, I like to travel and explore the world. I'm also a language learner. Besides my native Swedish, I speak English, and I also have an intermediate level of understanding in Spanish and Italian.

I'm also a contributor to projects on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/robertsundstrom), where I also share my own projects.

This site is, in fact, one of my projects. It’s written in C#, and executed by the [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) .NET runtime on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), a web standard, directly in your browser! The source code for this app can be found [here](https://github.com/robertsundstrom/blog).
