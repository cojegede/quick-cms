# Quick CMS

A quick and evolving client-side site generator for my own personal use written in C# with [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) web component framework.

Meant as a replacement for [CMS.js](https://github.com/chrisdiana/cms.js).

Experimental features in ```develop``` branch.

## Description

This app runs in the client browser, fetches static content (such as markdown files) that it then renders on the screen.

## Features
* Bootstrap theme
* Pages generated from markdown files.
* Configure from where what repository (or other location) to load pages.

## Development
Check ```develop``` for the latest experiments with blogging.

### To do
